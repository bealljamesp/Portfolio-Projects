Step 2 – Follow-Up Prompt (Start Project #1)

Great — now let’s start with Project #1 from that roadmap.

Please help me define the following for this project:

Problem Statement: the business or analytical question it answers.

Objectives & Deliverables: what outputs or insights I should produce.

Dataset Guidance: where to find or how to generate appropriate data.

Technical Stack: which tools, libraries, or files I’ll need to set up in VS Code.

Repository Structure: including folders (data/, src/, notebooks/, docs/, etc.) and any required setup files (requirements.txt, .gitignore, README.md).

Skill Demonstration: which key skills this project will showcase to a recruiter.

Then, help me initialize a working plan so I can start coding and structuring it locally.
