üéØ Putting It Together for Interviews

Business Analysis angle ‚Üí Show you can connect data insights to business value. (E.g., ‚ÄúI used SQL + Tableau to identify bottlenecks, then documented a new process with BPMN.‚Äù)

AI angle ‚Üí Show you understand both technical and ethical sides. (E.g., ‚ÄúI built a churn model but also measured fairness to avoid bias.‚Äù)

SCMG angle ‚Üí Show you can apply analytics to concrete supply chain decisions. (E.g., ‚ÄúI optimized reorder points under uncertain demand using Monte Carlo + EOQ.‚Äù)
