    # BLK-03 — Pharma Serialization (DSCSA Sim)

    **Why it matters:** Serialization and verification across partners to detect suspect products.

    ## Demo Scope
    - Pack→ship→receive chain with serial, lot, expiry anchored.
- Randomized verification and audit trail extraction.

    ## KPIs & Outcomes
    - Verification success rate
    - Time-to-verify
    - Suspect product detection

    ## Skill Takeaways
    - Serialization data structures
    - Anchoring identifiers & metadata
    - Sampling & verification flows
    - Compliance reporting basics

    ## How to Run
    1) Open `Blockchain/common/notebooks/01_hash_and_anchor.ipynb` to learn the local anchoring workflow.

    2) Explore this project's `notebooks/` for domain-specific examples.

    3) (Optional) Deploy `ProofOfProvenance.sol` to a testnet and replace the local registry with on-chain calls.
