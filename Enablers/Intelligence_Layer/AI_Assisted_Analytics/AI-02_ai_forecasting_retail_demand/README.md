# AI Forecasting for Retail Demand

📂 **Project Code:** AI-02  
📄 **Context:** AI / Forecasting  
📅 **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## 📌 Overview
Apply ML/DL models (LSTMs, Gradient Boosting) to retail demand forecasting and benchmark against ARIMA.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Compare ML/DL with classical forecasting.  
- Evaluate accuracy and scalability.

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools
- **Primary:** LSTM (Deep Learning)  
- **Comparisons:** ARIMA, Prophet, Gradient Boosting  
- **Stack:** Python (tensorflow/keras, scikit-learn, statsmodels)

## 🔍 Comparison & Justification
- *ARIMA:* statistical baseline.  
- *Prophet:* quick, interpretable.  
- *LSTM:* captures long-term dependencies.  
- **Chosen:** LSTM when dataset is large, ARIMA/Prophet when simpler/less data.

## 📊 Results
MAPE/RMSE comparisons across models.

## 📈 Business Impact
Improved retail replenishment, fewer stockouts, optimized working capital.
