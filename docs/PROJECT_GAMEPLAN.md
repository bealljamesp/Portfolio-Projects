## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Rhythm

Each project includes:

* **README.md:** Professional overview and reproducibility notes.
* **Jupyter Notebook(s):** Analytical workflow and decision simulations.
* **src Folder:** Modular, documented Python code for models and simulations.
* **config.yaml:** Reproducible parameter control.
* **reports Folder:** Visuals, summaries, and stakeholder insights.
