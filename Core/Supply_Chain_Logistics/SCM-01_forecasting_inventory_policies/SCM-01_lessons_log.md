### Entry ‚Äì 2025-10-14

**Category:** Governance  
**Lesson:**  
It would have been helpful to have a concise one-page *Project Overview* describing the scenario and analytical plan before running setup. This missing context made early alignment less efficient.

**Resolution / Action:**  
Created `SCM-01_Project_Overview.md` and standardized its inclusion in every project folder via the `manual_project_creation_checklist.md`. This ensures each project begins with both technical and narrative context.
