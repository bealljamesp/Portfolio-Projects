# üß≠ Central Handoff Standards (v1.0)

**Purpose:**  
Define the standard structure and expectations for project handoffs to Central Workspace.  
Ensure continuity, reproducibility, and portfolio-wide learning across GPT instances.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Handoff Purpose
Each project concludes with a structured transfer of all relevant files, insights, and standards updates to Central Workspace.  
Central acts as the *portfolio integrator*, responsible for maintaining documentation, updating templates, and preparing the next project.
