# Food Traceability Proof-of-Concept (Blockchain)

📂 **Project Code:** BLK-01  
📄 **Context:** Blockchain / Supply Chain  
📅 **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## 📌 Overview
Implement a blockchain-based system to trace food origin and movement through the supply chain.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Record product provenance on an immutable ledger.  
- Compare blockchain vs central DB approaches.

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools
- **Primary:** Ethereum smart contracts  
- **Comparisons:** Central DB logs  
- **Data Emphasis:** *Blockchain Traceability* (see [Blockchain](../../glossary.md#-blockchain--emerging-tech))

## 🔍 Comparison & Justification
- *Central DB:* fast but alterable.  
- *Blockchain:* immutable, decentralized.  
- **Chosen:** Blockchain for regulatory compliance and consumer trust.

## 📊 Results
Prototype contracts, transaction logs.

## 📈 Business Impact
Improved transparency, compliance, reduced recalls.
