I’m ready to start building my professional analyst portfolio from scratch.

I want to create a 10-project roadmap that demonstrates full analyst capability — from data fundamentals and statistics through advanced analytics, AI-assisted methods, and system-level capabilities.

Please design a structured roadmap for me that:

Covers the core analyst toolkit (Python, SQL, Excel, visualization, statistics).

Includes industry applications (e.g., supply chain, finance, marketing, sustainability, operations).

Integrates capability layers (Governance & Ethics, Analytical Intelligence, Systems & Infrastructure).

Shows a logical progression from foundational to advanced projects.

Suggests what datasets or data types I should use for each project.

Explains how each project contributes to my overall professional readiness.

Present it in a clear table or structured outline, with rationale for each project.
