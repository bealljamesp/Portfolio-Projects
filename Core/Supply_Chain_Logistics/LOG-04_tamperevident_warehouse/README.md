# Tamper-Evident Warehouse Systems

📂 **Project Code:** LOG-04  
📄 **Context:** Logistics / Emerging Tech  
📅 **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## 📌 Overview
Prototype a tamper-evident tracking system for warehouse operations, leveraging IoT sensors and blockchain integration.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Monitor warehouse asset integrity.  
- Record tamper events in immutable ledger.  

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools
- **Primary:** IoT sensors + Blockchain logging
- **Comparisons:** Paper-based seals, centralized DB logs
- **Data Emphasis:** *Blockchain & Logistics* (see [Blockchain](../../glossary.md#-blockchain--emerging-tech))

## 🔍 Comparison & Justification
- *Paper seals:* cheap but tamper-prone.  
- *Central DB:* faster but alterable.  
- *Blockchain:* immutable, verifiable, decentralized.  
- **Chosen:** Blockchain integration for trusted, auditable trail.

## 📊 Results
Proof-of-concept system design; mock event logs.

## 📈 Business Impact
Enhanced supply chain security, regulatory compliance, customer trust.
