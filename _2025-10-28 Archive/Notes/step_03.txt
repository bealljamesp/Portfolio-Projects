Step 3 – Review Prompt (Post-Project Evaluation)

I’ve completed my first portfolio project and want you to review it as if you were a hiring manager or senior analyst assessing a candidate’s work.

Please evaluate the following:

Repository Structure: Does it follow professional standards (data/, src/, notebooks/, docs/, visuals/, tests/)?

File Naming and Organization: Are naming conventions, folder hierarchy, and commit history clear and consistent?

README.md: Is it recruiter-friendly? Does it explain the business problem, analytical method, and results effectively?

Code Quality: Are docstrings, comments, and modularization professional? Is the code readable and reproducible?

Analytical Rigor: Is the math/statistics sound? Are methods appropriate and results interpretable?

Business Communication: Are insights clearly connected to business value and decision-making?

Professional Readiness: Does this project demonstrate industry-level competence and independence?

Give your review in a structured format:

Assessment: summarize strengths and weaknesses

Recommendations: actionable improvements

Rationale: why each suggestion matters for professional credibility

Include any examples, rewrites, or best-practice snippets that would elevate it to “hire-ready” quality.
