# Supply Chain & Logistics

📂 **Folder:** Core/Supply_Chain_Logistics
🧭 **Decision Focus:** Forecasting → Inventory → Simulation → Optimization
🧩 **Enabler Mapping:** AI-Assisted Analytics • Simulation & Digital Twins • Optimization/RL
💻 **Environment:** Conda `analytics_portfolio`, VS Code, Jupyter

---

## 📘 Overview
This folder contains **Decision-Intelligence projects** focused on supply-chain operations — from demand forecasting and inventory control to logistics network optimization and simulation-based policy testing.

Projects in this domain illustrate how **predictive, prescriptive, and simulation analytics** interact to drive operational decisions with measurable ROI.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build explainable forecasting and inventory policy models.
- Use simulation to evaluate uncertainty and risk in supply networks.
- Connect operational KPIs (cost, service level, reliability) to strategic decisions.
- Provide modular, reusable pipelines that support higher-layer enablers such as AI forecasting and Responsible AI dashboards.
