# Pharma Serialization & DSCSA Simulation (Blockchain)

📂 **Project Code:** BLK-03  
📄 **Context:** Blockchain / Pharmaceutical SCM  
📅 **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## 📌 Overview
Simulate compliance with the U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) using blockchain for pharmaceutical serialization.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Record unique identifiers for pharmaceutical products.  
- Trace and verify product journey through the supply chain.

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools
- **Primary:** Blockchain serialization ledger  
- **Comparisons:** Central DB serialization, paper-based systems  
- **Data Emphasis:** *Blockchain + SCM Compliance* (see [Traceability](../../glossary.md#-blockchain--emerging-tech))

## 🔍 Comparison & Justification
- *Paper-based:* error-prone, slow.  
- *Central DB:* faster, but vulnerable to tampering.  
- *Blockchain:* immutable, interoperable, regulator-friendly.  
- **Chosen:** Blockchain for compliance and secure traceability.

## 📊 Results
Proof-of-concept system; mock serialization logs.

## 📈 Business Impact
Reduced counterfeit risk, DSCSA compliance, improved patient safety.
