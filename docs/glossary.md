## ðŸ“Š Data Analysis & Statistics

**Note:** Each method is not only defined but also includes *common comparisons* to highlight when and why it is chosen over alternatives.

| Term | Definition | Use Cases |
|------|------------|-----------|
| **Data Analysis** | Inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover insights and support decision-making. | BUSN501 final paper; MSABA-01 (Churn Prediction); MSABA-02 (A/B Testing) |
| **Big Data** | Extremely large and complex datasets that require specialized tools (e.g., Hadoop, Spark) to process, analyze, and extract value. | BUSN501 portfolio emphasis; SCMG coursework |
| **Regression** | Statistical method for modeling the relationship between variables (simple/multiple). **Common comparisons:** Logistic Regression (interpretability) vs. Random Forest/XGBoost (accuracy/power). | MSABA-01 (Logistic Regression), MSABA-04 (Pricing Optimization), Week 5 discussion |
| **Hypothesis Testing** | Testing assumptions about a population using sample data. | MSABA-02 (A/B Testing) |
| **Confidence Interval** | Range of values likely to contain the true population parameter. | MSABA-02 (Power Analysis, A/B Testing); BUSN501 Week 7 Flaws |
| **ARIMA** | (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) Time series forecasting model using past values and past errors. **Common comparisons:** vs. ETS (trend/seasonality), vs. Prophet (business calendars). | MSABA-03 (Time Series Forecasting); BUSN501 Week 5 discussion |
| **Monte Carlo Simulation** | Random sampling technique for modeling uncertainty and risk. **Common comparisons:** vs. Scenario Analysis (limited cases) and Analytical Models (closed form but less flexible). | LOG-03 (Network Optimization Monte Carlo); BUSN501 Week 7 Flaws |
