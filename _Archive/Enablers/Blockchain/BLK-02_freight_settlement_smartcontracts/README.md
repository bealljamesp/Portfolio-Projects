# Freight Settlement with Smart Contracts

📂 **Project Code:** BLK-02  
📄 **Context:** Blockchain / Logistics Finance  
📅 **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## 📌 Overview
Prototype a blockchain-based freight settlement system where payments are automatically triggered via smart contracts once delivery milestones are met.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate freight payments with smart contracts.  
- Compare blockchain automation vs traditional EDI systems.

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools
- **Primary:** Ethereum smart contracts (Solidity)  
- **Comparisons:** Centralized EDI/payment platforms  
- **Data Emphasis:** *Blockchain + Logistics* (see [Smart Contracts](../../glossary.md#-blockchain--emerging-tech))

## 🔍 Comparison & Justification
- *EDI systems:* established, reliable, but manual reconciliation often needed.  
- *Smart contracts:* self-executing, immutable, reduce disputes.  
- **Chosen:** Smart contracts for automation and transparency; EDI as fallback.

## 📊 Results
Demo smart contract, simulated transactions, gas cost analysis.

## 📈 Business Impact
Reduced settlement times, fewer disputes, lower admin costs.
