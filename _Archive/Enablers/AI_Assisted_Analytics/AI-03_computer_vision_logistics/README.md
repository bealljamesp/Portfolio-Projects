# Computer Vision in Logistics

📂 **Project Code:** AI-03  
📄 **Context:** AI / Logistics  
📅 **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## 📌 Overview
Use computer vision (CV) for package detection, quality inspection, and automated tracking in logistics.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build CV models for object detection/classification.  
- Compare DL CNNs vs traditional vision methods.

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools
- **Primary:** CNNs (TensorFlow/PyTorch)  
- **Comparisons:** Traditional CV (OpenCV feature methods)  
- **Data Emphasis:** *Deep Learning + Logistics* (see [DL](../../glossary.md#-ai-ml--dl-in-scm))

## 🔍 Comparison & Justification
- *CNNs:* high accuracy, scalable with data.  
- *Traditional CV:* simpler, lighter compute.  
- **Chosen:** CNNs for accuracy on real-world logistics images.

## 📊 Results
Model accuracy, confusion matrices, bounding box visualizations.

## 📈 Business Impact
Automation reduces errors, improves warehouse throughput.
