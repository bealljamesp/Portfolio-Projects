# Blockchain-Traceability and Digital Twin Link

📂 **Project Code:** SCM-03  
📄 **Context:** Supply Chain / Blockchain / AI  
📅 **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## 📌 Overview
Integrate blockchain-based traceability with digital twin models, enabling real-time trusted data feeds for supply chain simulations.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Combine blockchain provenance data with digital twin simulations.  
- Evaluate benefits of immutable input data for scenario modeling.

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools
- **Primary:** Blockchain + Digital Twin integration  
- **Comparisons:** Digital Twin without blockchain feeds  
- **Data Emphasis:** *Blockchain + AI/SCM* (see [Proof of Provenance](../../glossary.md#-blockchain--emerging-tech))

## 🔍 Comparison & Justification
- *Digital Twin only:* dynamic but relies on potentially corruptible inputs.  
- *With Blockchain:* trusted, tamper-proof inputs for reliable simulation.  
- **Chosen:** Integration for secure and accurate twin-based decisions.

## 📊 Results
Demo integration architecture; example simulation outputs with blockchain-fed data.

## 📈 Business Impact
Stronger supply chain transparency, resilience, and decision confidence.

## 📚 References
