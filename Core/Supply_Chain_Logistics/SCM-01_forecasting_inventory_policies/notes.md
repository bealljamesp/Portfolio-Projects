🧭 Learning Continuity — SCM-01 Context

Carry-over focus from “General Questions” Chat

Guiding Principle — Predictable, Not Mysterious

Every system, model, or result should behave in ways that are transparent, explainable, and reproducible.
No “magic,” no guessing.

🔍 Interpretation

Environment Predictability
Conda, Jupyter, Ruff, and VS Code behavior are understood and intentional — nothing “just happens.”

Code Predictability
Each function’s purpose and flow can be reasoned through from inputs → processing → outputs.

Result Predictability
You can explain why forecasts, KPIs, or simulation results change — always traceable to data, parameters, or model logic.

Process Predictability
Same data + same parameters ⇒ same output, with clear configuration and version control.

🎓 Professional Profile Alignment

From the Professional Profile learning goals:

Understand why parameters, models, and data transformations produce specific results.

Emphasize AI-assisted analytics and decision intelligence, not rote coding.

Strengthen statistical intuition and model reasoning (forecasting, optimization, simulation).

Build the ability to defend and explain analytical decisions with clarity and rigor.

🧩 Application in SCM-01

Treat every module (forecasting.py, inventory.py, simulation.py, main.py) as a transparent system: map inputs, outputs, and assumptions.

Use this chat (SCM-01) for implementation, applied reasoning, and technical walk-throughs.

Use General Questions for conceptual or cross-project exploration.
