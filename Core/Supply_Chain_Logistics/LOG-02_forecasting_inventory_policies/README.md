# Forecasting & Inventory Policy (EOQ, Safety Stock)

📂 **Project Code:** LOG-02  
📄 **Context:** Logistics / Inventory Management  
📅 **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## 📌 Overview
Apply demand forecasting and inventory models (EOQ, safety stock) to optimize replenishment policies.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Forecast demand using historical data.
- Calculate EOQ, reorder points, and safety stock.

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools
- **Primary:** EOQ + Safety Stock calculations
- **Comparisons:** Heuristic reorder rules, Just-in-Time systems
- **Stack:** Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib), Excel
- **Data Emphasis:** *Data Analysis & SCM* (see [EOQ](../../glossary.md#-logistics--supply-chain))

## 🔍 Comparison & Justification
- **EOQ vs JIT vs Heuristic rules**  
  - *EOQ:* balances order/holding costs.  
  - *JIT:* minimal inventory, high risk if supply uncertain.  
  - *Heuristics:* simple but suboptimal.  
- **Chosen:** EOQ with safety stock for robust yet cost-effective inventory policies.

## 📊 Results
Graphs of forecast vs actual demand; EOQ sensitivity to holding costs.

## 📈 Business Impact
Reduced stockouts and excess inventory, saving working capital.
