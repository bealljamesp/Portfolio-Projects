# ðŸ“˜ Portfolio Lessons Learned Log

**Purpose:**
Document insights, outcomes, and transferable lessons from each project to strengthen the portfolioâ€™s collective intelligence and reproducibility standards.

Each entry should summarize what was learned technically, organizationally, and conceptually.
Use this log as both a historical record and a feedback mechanism for improving the manual project creation checklist and governance framework.

## ðŸ§­ Format Overview

| Section | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Summary** | A short paragraph describing what the project accomplished and how it fits into the portfolio. |
| **Technical Wins** | Successful implementations, efficient methods, or breakthroughs that worked well. |
| **Pain Points** | Frictions, issues, or areas that caused inefficiency or confusion. |
| **Process Lessons** | Workflow or organizational improvements learned during development. |
| **Governance Insights** | Key takeaways on traceability, ethics, reproducibility, or model explainability. |
| **Next Project Prep** | Adjustments or recommendations for the next project phase. |

## ðŸ§© Example Entry â€“ SCM-01 Forecasting Inventory Policies

**Summary:**
Developed a forecasting-to-decision pipeline integrating demand prediction, inventory policy simulation, and dashboard planning. Established baseline reproducibility contracts and structural standards for all future projects.

**Technical Wins:**
- Sanity Check Cell successfully standardized environment validation.
- Integrity Checker confirmed project reproducibility across environments.
- Established config-driven forecasting and simulation parameters.

**Pain Points:**
- Duplicated data folders caused early confusion before standardizing SoT (`data/`).
- Initial notebook lacked deterministic seeding until added later.

**Process Lessons:**
- Run integrity check before modeling to catch config and directory issues early.
- Keep `model_card.md` and `decision_dashboard_spec.md` under development alongside the codeâ€”not afterward.

**Governance Insights:**
- Sanity Check Cell metadata (config hash, git commit) proved valuable for traceability.
- Explicit model cards improved communication of analytical decisions.

**Next Project Prep:**
- Use `pyproject_portfolio.toml` template from `_tools/templates` for consistent dependency pins.
- Begin DA-01 with the same structure, emphasizing interpretable model explainability.
