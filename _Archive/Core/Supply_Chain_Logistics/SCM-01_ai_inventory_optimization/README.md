# AI-Driven Inventory Optimization

📂 **Project Code:** SCM-01  
📄 **Context:** SCM + AI  
📅 **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## 📌 Overview
Use ML/AI models to optimize reorder points, EOQ, and safety stock dynamically.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Compare AI-based policies with classical EOQ.  
- Quantify cost savings and service level improvements.

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools
- **Primary:** ML models (Gradient Boosting, Reinforcement Learning)  
- **Comparisons:** EOQ formulas  
- **Data Emphasis:** *AI + SCM* (see [ML](../../glossary.md#-ai-ml--dl-in-scm))

## 🔍 Comparison & Justification
- *EOQ:* simple, analytical, static.  
- *AI models:* adaptive, data-driven.  
- **Chosen:** AI methods for volatile demand environments.

## 📊 Results
Cost savings, service level metrics, policy comparisons.

## 📈 Business Impact
Reduced working capital, better resilience to demand variability.
