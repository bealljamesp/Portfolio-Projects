# 📊 Analytics & Decision Intelligence Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio — a curated collection of projects demonstrating how **data, models, and human reasoning** combine to solve complex business, finance, and logistics challenges.

Each project blends **technical precision** with **strategic decision design**, illustrating the evolution from classic analytics to modern **Decision Intelligence**.

---

## 🧭 Portfolio Purpose

This portfolio bridges the gap between **descriptive analytics** and **decision-centric systems** that are explainable, ethical, and adaptive.

It serves two complementary goals:

1. **Professional Showcase:** Apply advanced analytical and AI-driven methods to real-world business, finance, logistics, and HR problems.  
2. **Learning Framework:** Deepen intuitive understanding of models, parameters, and system behavior — developing mathematical, statistical, and domain fluency.

> _Every project is both a demonstration and an experiment — solving real problems while expanding mastery and reasoning._

## ⚙️ Portfolio Architecture

The portfolio is organized into **Core Domains** (problem contexts) and **Next-Generation Enablers** (analytical capabilities).

### 🧱 **Core Domains — Where Problems Live**

| Folder | Focus | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Core/Data_Analytics/** | Foundational analytics | Forecasting, regression, dashboards, and optimization models that form the base of decision intelligence. |
| **Core/Supply_Chain_Logistics/** | Operations & logistics | Inventory, transportation, routing, and digital twin modeling for operational efficiency. |
| **Core/Finance/** | Financial analytics | Forecasting, valuation, ROI analysis, and capital decision models for financial planning and risk. |
| **Core/HR_People_Analytics/** | Workforce analytics | Retention, performance, and human-centered decision modeling. |

### 🧩 **Next-Generation Enablers — How Problems Are Solved**

Organized into three functional layers reflecting how modern decision systems evolve from intelligence to governance.

#### 🧠 **Intelligence Layer**
Focus: reasoning, modeling, and interpretability.  
- `AI_Assisted_Analytics/` — AI tools (GPT, AutoML, Copilot) accelerating analytical work.  
- `Explainable_AI/` — Transparency via SHAP, LIME, and interpretable models.  
- `Optimization_RL/` — Reinforcement learning and prescriptive optimization.  
- `Causal_Graphs/` — Modeling cause-effect relationships with Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

#### 🏗️ **System Layer**
Focus: simulation, connectivity, and systemic reasoning.  
- `Simulation_Digital_Twins/` — Virtual models of logistics and business systems for testing scenarios.  
- `Edge_IoT/` — Real-time analytics from sensors and streaming data.  
- `Knowledge_Graphs/` — Contextual data linking for semantic reasoning.  
- `Sim_Opt_Hybrids/` — Hybrid simulation-optimization models for planning and scheduling.

#### ⚖️ **Governance Layer**
Focus: ethics, transparency, and human alignment.  
- `Blockchain/` — Provenance tracking, smart contracts, and distributed trust.  
- `Responsible_AI/` — Model lineage, bias metrics, and governance dashboards.  
- `Human_AI_Collaboration/` — Decision copilots and human-AI workflow design.  
- `Generative_Support/` — LLM-driven scenario reports and automated documentation.  
- `Ethical_AI_Policy/` — Frameworks and principles for responsible AI practice.

## 🧠 Learning & Mastery Framework

Every project reflects **two complementary dimensions**:

| Dimension | Focus |
|------------|--------|
| **External Goal – Professional Showcase** | Apply analytical methods or technologies to realistic, data-driven business problems. |
| **Internal Goal – Learning & Mastery** | Develop mathematical/statistical fluency, understand parameter sensitivity, and expand professional vocabulary. |

Each project README addresses:
- Problem & scenario  
- Methods and enablers applied  
- Solution & insight  
- Reflection on learning and terminology
