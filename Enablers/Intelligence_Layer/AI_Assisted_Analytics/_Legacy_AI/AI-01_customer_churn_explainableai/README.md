# Explainable AI for Customer Churn

📂 **Project Code:** AI-01  
📄 **Context:** AI / Data Analytics  
📅 **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## 📌 Overview
Enhance churn prediction models with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like SHAP to balance accuracy and interpretability.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Train advanced models (Random Forest/XGBoost).  
- Apply SHAP/LIME to explain predictions.  

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools
- **Primary:** Tree-based ML + SHAP  
- **Comparisons:** Logistic Regression (baseline)  
- **Data Emphasis:** *AI/ML + Explainability* (see [ML](../../glossary.md#-ai-ml--dl-in-scm))

## 🔍 Comparison & Justification
- *LogReg:* transparent but less accurate.  
- *RF/XGB:* accurate but opaque.  
- **Chosen:** RF/XGB + SHAP to combine performance and interpretability.

## 📊 Results
Feature importance rankings, churn risk dashboards.

## 📈 Business Impact
Actionable insights for retention strategies with stakeholder trust.
