# Digital Twin of Supply Chain

📂 **Project Code:** SCM-02  
📄 **Context:** Supply Chain + AI  
📅 **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## 📌 Overview
Develop a digital twin of the supply chain that integrates real-time data and simulation for decision support.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Simulate supply chain scenarios (demand spikes, disruptions).  
- Compare digital twin vs static planning models.

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools
- **Primary:** Digital Twin simulation with AI/ML integration  
- **Comparisons:** Spreadsheet/static models  
- **Data Emphasis:** *Digital Twin + AI/SCM* (see [Digital Twin](../../glossary.md#-ai-ml--dl-in-scm))

## 🔍 Comparison & Justification
- *Static models:* simple, fast, but no real-time insights.  
- *Digital Twin:* dynamic, predictive, scenario-rich.  
- **Chosen:** Digital Twin for resilience planning and proactive management.

## 📊 Results
Scenario analysis dashboards; simulation of disruptions.

## 📈 Business Impact
Improved resilience, agility, and customer service under uncertainty.
