# Blockchain Integration Stub

This folder holds minimal examples showing **where** and **how** to plug blockchain-derived signals into this project.

## Examples
- Hash invoice/PO PDFs or CSVs and store hex digests in a registry (local or on-chain).
- Join provenance risk, batch/lot anchors, or temperature-excursion flags into KPIs or optimization costs.
